# Cyber-Octopus 👾

**Cyber-Octopus** is a collection of hands-on cybersecurity and pentesting tools/experiments — ranging from network scanning & brute-forcing to exploitation and reconnaissance scripts.  
This repo served as my playground to explore common security vulnerabilities and build small tools around them.

## 🗃️ Contents & Project Structure  

- `project-arp-spoofing/` — ARP spoofing / MITM-style attack experiments  
- `project-backdoor/` — Backdoor / reverse-shell experiments  
- `project-hidden-directory-discovery/` — Tools for discovering hidden directories (e.g. brute-forcing possible paths)  
- `project-login-bruteforce/` — Simple login brute-force scripts  
- Misc scripts in root (or subfolders): network scanners, password-crackers, port-scanners, proof-of-concept payloads, etc.  

> 🔒 **Note:** These projects are primarily for learning, experimentation, or educational use. Misuse is strongly discouraged.

## 🧪 What It Covers (Phases of Cybersecurity)  

The repo explores several typical phases of a security-assessment workflow:

1. **Reconnaissance / Information Gathering** — e.g. hidden directory discovery, scanning  
2. **Scanning** — network / port scanning tools  
3. **Gaining Access / Exploitation** — backdoors, payloads, brute-force scripts, ARP spoofing, etc.  
4. **Maintaining Access & Post-Exploitation (Proof-of-Concepts)** — reverse shells, persistent access tools  
5. **Cleanup / Covering Tracks** — (if applicable / conceptual)  

These phases are approximate and overlap depending on the tool being used.

## 🚧 Current Status  

- This repository is currently archived / on hold — I may or may not return to actively develop or maintain it.  
- The code is largely for educational purposes, proof-of-concept, or personal learning — not intended for production use.  
- Use responsibly. I do **not** endorse or support malicious use.  

---

## 🎯 Why This Repo Exists  

- To **learn by doing** — gain hands-on experience with security vulnerabilities and basic pentesting tools  
- To **have a sandbox** to experiment with networking, scripting, exploitation workflows in Python / shell / etc.  
- To **build foundational knowledge** for cybersecurity fundamentals, which might help later if I choose to dive deeper or build more serious security tools.

## 📝 How to Use / Run

Most of the content consists of small standalone scripts or experiment folders.

### 1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bharadwaja1557/Cyber-Octopus.git
   cd Cyber-Octopus
  ```

### 2. Navigate into any project folder:
(Change directory into the project you want to explore.)

### 3. Open the script files:
(Read the comments inside each script to understand how it works and how to run it.)

### ✔️ Requirements (depending on the specific tool)

- Python 3  
- Extra libraries (varies per folder)  
- Root/sudo privileges (for networking tools)  
- A controlled environment where you **have explicit permission** to test

> ⚠️ **Use responsibly. Never run these tools on machines or networks you do not own or control.**
